Then, in an effort to reduce duplicates when joining the tables, which don't have this unique ID number that is included in the PDF....I'll ask about that when I hear from the State Police. In the meantime, I did a slight modification to this sheet. I removed one of the Atlantic Guns locations. They are both in Montgomery county, but were getting doubled, I also removed a duplicate in spelling J & S pawn had two separate spellings of the same address. And I changed the name of 1237 gun shop to .1237 to be consisitent with the guns table it is saved into a new spreadsheet. \nshops <- read_csv('mod_active_firearms_dealers.csv')\n\n\n#this database also may contain non-gun parts like magazines and other gun accessories. May need to split data into two sets one that has null items under barrel length one that does not have nulls in barrel length. \n#I also found through some testing that there are duplicate values in application numbers....I first detected this when I did a left join and got more observations then when I started. That will have to be dealt witjh at a later date.  I don't know why this is and will ask the state police upon getting a new version of this data. However, for the time being, I will use the distinct() operator in DPLYR to see if I can try and cut out these duplicates. \n\n#NOTICED THAT there are multiple values in the guns table. \n#guns_count <- guns %>%\n#  group_by (`Application Number`)%>%\n#  summarise(count = n()) %>%\n#  arrange(desc(count))\n\n#went back and made sure the appliocation numbers and observation values are the same before and after data cleaning.
